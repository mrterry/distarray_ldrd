Post-Processing Parallel Data with a Serial-like Interface
----------------------------------------------------------

At the present, there are two dominate means of interactively post-processing the output of large simulations.  The first is to process the data using a scripting language like Python or Yorick.  These languages have powerful high level constructs for working with data.  However, existing technologies for loading and manipulating data are serial only.  This significantly constrains the size of the simulation that can be considered.  The second method is to use a parallel visualisation tool like VisIt or Paraview.  While these tools can accept very large data sources, they lack the flexibility of direct access using a scripting language.

We propose the development of a script-able platform for manipulating parallel data with a familiar serial-like interface.  The goal is to build the correct infrastructure such that the user can make use of additional cores and additional machines, but without manually managing parallel data.  The platform would use the Python language and extend the existing Numpy N-dimensional array to work with memory distributed data.  The platform would build on the existing IPython clustering and interactivity work.  The platform would initially be targeted at processing Hydra output, but techniques and software would be easily extend-able to other codes using a structured mesh and possibly to those with unstructured meshes.
